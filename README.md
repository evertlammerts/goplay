# Multi-Core Parallel Programming in Go [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evertlammerts/mcppg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/evertlammerts/mcppg)

This package provides an implementation of the parallel trapezoid function for estimating definite integrals of single variable functions. It is based on the implementation as described in "[Multi-Core Parallel Programming in Go](http://www.ualr.edu/pxtang/papers/acc10.pdf)" (Peiyi Tang, 2010). This is most of all a way for me to get more familiar with Go.

## Issues

I'd love to hear about them on the github issue tracker.
