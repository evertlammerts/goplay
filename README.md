# Multi-Core Parallel Programming in Go

This package provides an implementation of the parallel trapezoid function for estimating definite integrals of single variable functions. It is based on the implementation as described in "[Multi-Core Parallel Programming in Go](http://www.ualr.edu/pxtang/papers/acc10.pdf)" (Peiyi Tang, 2010). This is most of all a way for me to get more familiar with Go.

## Issues

I'd love to hear about them on the github issue tracker.
